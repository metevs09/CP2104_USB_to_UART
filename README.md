## Prerequisites

- CP210x Drivers: Ensure that you have the latest CP210x drivers installed on your computer. You can download them from the Silicon Labs website.
- PCB Fabrication: Access to a PCB manufacturing service if you plan to build the hardware.
- Basic Electronics Knowledge: Familiarity with reading schematics and assembling electronic circuits.
  
Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/metevs09/CP2104_USB_to_UART.git
```
2. Review the Schematics:

- Open the files in the schematics/ folder using your preferred schematic editor.
  
3. PCB Fabrication:

- Use the design files in the pcb/ folder to order your PCB.

4. Assembly:
- Follow the detailed instructions in the docs/ folder for component placement and soldering.
  
5. Driver Installation:

- Install the CP210x drivers on your computer to enable proper USB-to-UART communication.

## Usage
Once the hardware is assembled:

- Connect: Plug the USB connector into your computer.
- Communicate: The converter will be recognized as a virtual COM port. Use any terminal program (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term) to interface with your UART device.
- Test: Verify communication by sending and receiving serial data through the converter.
> Note: Always observe proper safety precautions when assembling and testing electronic circuits.
